    <h1>Analysis Results</h1>

    <p>This page will display:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A privacy risk score (0–100)</li>
      <li>Detected sensitive locations (home, work, etc.)</li>
      <li>An interactive map with highlighted risk zones</li>
      <li>Recommendations to reduce re-identification risk</li>
    </ul>

    <!--
    WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD/EDIT IN THIS TEMPLATE:

    1. Display the risk score
       - Add a spot to show the numeric risk score (0–100) passed from `app.py`.
       - For example, display it prominently and optionally classify it
         as "Low", "Medium", or "High" risk based on simple thresholds.

    2. Show detected sensitive locations
       - Loop over a list of sensitive locations (provided by `analysis.py` through `app.py`), and display:
           * The label (e.g., "Home", "Work", "Gym").
           * The approximate coordinates or a vague description if you want to avoid precision.
           * Simple stats like number of visits or typical times, if provided.

    3. Show recommendations
       - Loop over a list of recommendation strings and display them in a bullet list.
       - Make the language clear and user-friendly (e.g., "Trim the first/last 500m around home").

    4. Embed or link to the Folium map
       - You will get the map HTML file path (e.g., under `static/maps/...`) from `app.py`.
       - Choose one of the approaches:
           * Use an <iframe> to embed the map HTML directly on this page.
           * Or provide a link/button that opens the map in a new tab.

    5. Navigation / repeat analysis
       - Add a button or link to go back to the upload page so users can analyze another file.
